# Learning Guide

# Core DevOps Practices

This course provided me with hands-on experience and foundational knowledge in key DevOps concepts and tools, including:

## Building Reliable Environments with Docker
Docker enables the creation of portable, consistent application environments across development, testing, and production stages through containerization.

## Automating Workflows with GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions simplifies the process of implementing CI/CD workflows, allowing for the automation of testing, building, and deploying applications directly from repositories.

## Kubernetes for Scalable Application Orchestration
Kubernetes provides powerful tools for managing and scaling containerized applications, with features like auto-scaling, rolling updates, and fault tolerance.

## Streamlining Configurations with YAML
YAML, a human-readable configuration language, is widely used for defining infrastructure setups, Kubernetes manifests, and CI/CD workflows.

## Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
Terraform automates the provisioning and management of infrastructure using declarative configuration files, making environments consistent and repeatable.

## Exploring Minikube for Local Kubernetes
Minikube enables developers to test Kubernetes configurations locally in an isolated environment, simplifying debugging and experimentation.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) vs. Infrastructure from Code (IfC)

- **IaC**: Defines infrastructure using reusable declarative code.
- **IfC**: Dynamically configures infrastructure based on the application's logic, often seen in serverless setups.

## Managed Kubernetes Offerings (AKS, EKS, GKE)
Managed Kubernetes services like AKS, EKS, and GKE reduce operational complexity by handling cluster management tasks, such as upgrades and scaling.

## GitOps for Declarative Infrastructure Management
GitOps treats Git as a single source of truth for infrastructure, enabling consistent and automated deployments through declarative configurations.

## Service Mesh with Istio
Istio facilitates secure and observable communication between microservices, with features like traffic routing and monitoring.

## Knative for Serverless Workloads
Knative extends Kubernetes capabilities to support serverless applications, providing automatic scaling and event-driven architecture.

## Kyverno for Kubernetes Policy Management
Kyverno enforces Kubernetes policies for resource allocation, security, and compliance checks in a declarative way.

## Personal Contributions and Projects

### **InterExplorer: Semantic Search Engine for YouTube Videos**  
*Link: [HuggingFace Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/afaqdean/InterExblorer)*

- Created a search engine using semantic search to query YouTube videos.
- Scraped YouTube for links and transcripts, vectorized text using a BERT sentence transformer, and uploaded the vectors to Pinecone.
- Used Pinecone API to search for the 3 most similar video entries based on the query text.
- The search engine provides YouTube links embedded with the exact timeframe of the query words.
- Dockerized and hosted the solution on Hugging Face.

### **Docker Guide for JSPaint**

- Created a comprehensive guide to dockerizing JSPaint, an open-source web-based paint application.
- Demonstrated the process of building, containerizing, and running JSPaint in a Docker container, making it easily deployable and portable.
- Utilized Docker Compose for handling container orchestration and integration with the necessary dependencies.
